Supplementary materials: Retinal vascular feature extraction and selection for kidney outcome prediction

This repository contains the supplementary methods, figures, and tables supporting the extraction, exploratory analysis, and outcome-agnostic selection of handcrafted retinal vascular features used across kidney-related prediction studies, including:

eGFR regression

ESRD risk and survival modelling

The materials in this repository correspond to Supplementary Methods S1 and Supplementary Figures S1–S5 of the associated manuscripts.

Scope and purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide transparent and reproducible documentation of the retinal vascular feature engineering pipeline used prior to predictive modelling.
All analyses presented here were conducted independently of outcome labels and before model training, and therefore apply equally across downstream tasks.

This repository does not contain model training, prediction, or performance evaluation code.

Retinal vascular features

An initial set of handcrafted retinal vascular features was extracted from automated vessel segmentations derived from colour fundus photographs. These features were designed to capture complementary aspects of retinal microvascular architecture, including:

Global vascular extent

Vessel calibre

Network complexity

Geometric morphology

A redundancy-aware exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to assess feature distributions, multicollinearity, and latent structure.

Outcome-agnostic feature selection

Feature selection was conducted using an outcome-agnostic strategy, defined here as selection based exclusively on:

Distributional properties (e.g. skewness, stability after transformation),

Correlation structure and redundancy, and

Biological interpretability of distinct vascular domains,

without incorporating information from kidney outcomes (eGFR, ESRD, or related endpoints).

Highly collinear features representing overlapping constructs (e.g. multiple proxies of vessel size or extent) were not retained simultaneously.

Based on this analysis, a parsimonious subset of four retinal vascular features was selected for downstream modelling:

Vessel density – global vascular extent / perfusion

Mean vessel width – vessel calibre

Fractal dimension – network complexity

Eccentricity – global vascular geometry

These features capture complementary biological dimensions while minimising redundancy and improving interpretability.

Exploratory analyses included

The supplementary materials include the following diagnostic analyses:

Correlation heatmap of all extracted retinal vascular features

Distributional assessment using boxplots and histograms

Raw vs log-transformed feature distributions

Principal component analysis (PCA):

Explained variance across components

Two-dimensional projection (PC1 vs PC2)

PCA was used solely as a diagnostic tool to assess latent structure and redundancy and was not used for feature extraction, transformation, or model training.

Relationship to modelling repositories

This repository documents feature engineering and selection only.

Model development, training, and evaluation are implemented separately in project-specific repositories (e.g. eGFR regression or ESRD survival modelling pipelines), which reference this repository for feature definitions and selection rationale.

Citation

If you use or reference these materials, please cite the associated manuscript(s) and this repository as supplementary material.

A formal citation entry (DOI or Zenodo record) will be added upon publication.

Notes

This repository supersedes earlier internal exploratory documents and reflects the final, submission-ready supplementary methods.

Figures showing outcome stratification are presented for post-hoc interpretability only and were not used to inform feature selection.
